# 🚀 Scale Asynchronous Processing with Apex, Platform Events & More
### Dreamforce 2025 | Presented by Sai

This repository contains sample code, patterns, and resources from my Dreamforce 2025 session — **“Scale Asynchronous Processing with Apex, Platform Events & More.”**  
The session explores how to design robust, scalable, and efficient asynchronous architectures on the Salesforce Platform.

## 🎯 Overview

Modern Salesforce implementations often face challenges around data volume, transaction limits, and integration scalability.  
This session demonstrates practical strategies to **scale asynchronous operations**, using tools such as:

- **Apex Queueables and Platform Events** for decoupled communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** patterns
- **Error handling, retries, and observability best practices**
